# Crisp Deep Learning Paper Threading Group

## Introduction

Welcome to the Crisp Deep Learning Paper Threading Group! Our aim is to foster knowledge exchange, collaboration opportunities, and improve our spoken English skills. Here are the rules to ensure a smooth and productive experience for everyone:

Participation
- Commitment: Members are expected to commit to attending weekly sessions and participating actively in discussions.
- Prerequisite Knowledge: Participants should be familiar with basic deep learning techniques such as Gradient Descent, Transformers, and CNNs.

Meeting Structure
- Schedule: Meetings will be held once a week at a time agreed upon by all members.
- Presentation: Each week, one member will present a Deep Learning paper of their choice. The presentation should last between 20-40 minutes.
- Q&A Session: Following the presentation, there will be a 20-30 minute Q&A session where all members can ask questions and discuss the paper.

Paper Selection
- Relevance: The selected paper must be related to Deep Learning.
- Familiarity: Presenters should choose a paper they are familiar with to ensure a thorough and insightful presentation.
- Variety: Members are encouraged to select papers from different subfields of Deep Learning to broaden the group's exposure.

Presentation Guidelines
- Content: Presenters should cover the paperâ€™s motivation, key contributions, methodology, experiments, and results. Presenters should choose a paper they are familiar with to ensure a thorough and insightful presentation.
- Slides: At most one figure per slide.
